In advance of Checkpoint all of the constructors have been implemented and
tested to my satisfaction. The assignment and equalto operators have also
been implemented and tested.

Current testing is done in the lunaE6.cpp file. It prints out expected
value alongside actual value for a variety of scenarios.
